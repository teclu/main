== Introduction
K.N.S. AddressBook is a free Java desktop application available on link:mainstream-os[mainstream operating systems]. It
is designed for freelancers who are bound to their desks, making many calls to clients with the office's telephone,
simultaneously using their computer to find their clients' contact number.

Most of the interactions in K.N.S. AddressBook are done through an in-built link:#command-line-interface[Command Line
Interface] (CLI), which allows you do add, edit and remove contacts quickly with only the use of a keyboard.

This user guide will help you get started on using K.N.S. AddressBook, and show you how you can make use of it.

== Table of Contents
toc::[]

== Key Features
K.N.S. AddressBook has many useful features for you to use. Listed below are some key features found in K.N.S.
AddressBook that can help you out.

// tag::personpanel[]
=== Person Panel
This is where you will find a selected contact's information (_name, address, phone number, etc._) displayed neatly on
a single page. When you click on the currently displayed link:avatar[Avatar] of the contact, a new window will pop-up like so:

image::UiPersonPanel.png[width="497"]

When you click `load`, you will be given the option to select an image (_either in .JPG or .PNG format_) stored on
your computer. Afterwards, clicking `save` will let you replace the current Avatar of the contact.

// end::personpanel[]

In K.N.S. AddressBook v2.0, you can look forward to the following enhancements to Person Panel:

* *Notes*: You can record down miscellaneous information (_e.g. favourite food, pet peeves_) about a
contact.
* *Birthday Countdown & Reminders*: You'll always know whose birthday is coming up soon! You can also get a reminder in
advance of a contact's upcoming birthday; no more remembering and forgetting needed!

// tag::themeswitcher[]
=== Theme Switcher
When you click on 'Theme' in the Menu Bar, you should see 5 preset themes that you can choose for K.N.S. AddressBook:

image::UiThemeOptions.png[width="359"]

[TIP]
Alternatively, you can use the `theme` command to change the current display theme of K.N.S. AddressBook.

When running K.N.S. AddressBook for the first time, the `Light` theme is the default appearance setting. Clicking on any
of the other 4 preset themes will result in an immediate appearance change; hopefully one of these preset themes is to
your liking! Here is what K.N.S. AddressBook look's like in all 5 preset themes:

image::UiAllThemes.gif[width="668"]
// end::themeswitcher[]

In K.N.S. AddressBook v2.0, you can look forward to the following enhancements to Theme Switcher:

* *More Preset Themes*: 5 preset themes is definitely not enough. We want you to have more appearance options so that
K.N.S. AddressBook suits your style.
* *Custom Themes*: For the more tech-savvy users, we plan to let you change the colours of K.N.S. AddressBook via
import of link:cascading-style-sheets[Cascading Style Sheets] (CSS).

// tag::findbyallfield1[]
=== Find by All Field
You can find your contact by using any field as the search query. For example, you can type in a phone number as the search query, and the contact in your address book who has that phone number will appear in the search result.

Find by all field supports find by name, phone number, email, address, birthday, and tags.
// end::findbyallfield1[]

=== Saving the data
The Address Book's data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any executable command that changes the data. +
There is no need for you to save manually.

== Getting Started

=== Installation
.  If you have not done so, https://java.com/en/download/[download] and install Java version `1.8.0_60` (_or later_) on your computer.
+
[NOTE]
This application will not work with earlier versions of Java 8 (_anything before `1.8.0_60`_).
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` release link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the .jar file into any folder that you want to use as the home folder for your application.
.  Double-click the file to start the application. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) should appear in a few seconds as
such:

And that's all, you're now ready to use K.N.S. AddressBook!

=== Layout Overview
Here are the parts of K.N.S. AddressBook that you should take note of:

image::FirstTimeLaunch.png[width="766"]

* **Menu Bar**: This is where you can find the alternative ways to
** `Exit` the application,
** Change the current theme,
** and open the `Help` window.

* **Contact List**: You will find all your added contacts here. Only the name
and tag(s) of your contacts will be shown here.

* **Person Panel**: You can view all the saved information of a selected contact
in the contact list here.

* **Command Box**: Most of the interactions in K.N.S. AddressBook are done here.
Here, you can type a valid `command` to get things done.

* **Status Bar**: The total number of contacts you have saved, the last updated
timing, and the data path is shown here.

[NOTE]
The default window size of K.N.S. AddressBook is 1336 by 178. The window's size cannot be changed or maximised!

=== Warming Up
. There are 20 example contacts that are already pre-loaded for you to get familiarised with the features and commands
found in K.N.S. AddressBook. Clicking on any individual contact card will `select` it, showing you the contact's details
in the PersonPanel like so:
+
image::FirstTimeSelection.png[width="668"]
+
. Let's start off by clearing all these example contacts. Type the command *`clear`* in the command box at the
top, and press kbd:[Enter]. You should now see an empty Address Book as such:
+
image::FirstTimeClear.png[width="668"]
+
.  Now, you can add in your first contact! For example, type `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/JohnStreet
, Block 123, #01-01 b/01/01/1991 t/example` in the command box and press kbd:[Enter]. Click on the new contact; you
should see the following:
+
image::FirstTimeAdd.png[width="668"]
+
.  Uh oh! Looks like we did not type the correct name of the contact. To edit the name of the contact, type `edit n/
John **Dow**` in the command box and press kbd:[Enter]. You should now see the name change in the PersonPanel.
. It's time for John to be gone from your Address Book. Type `delete 1` and press kbd:[Enter] in order to remove him.
+
Congratulations! You have now mastered the basic commands found in the application. In order to have a better
understanding of all the available commands, you can check them out link:#Available-CLI-Commands[here].

// end::undoredo[]

// tag::exim[]

=== Saving/Backing up your data: `export` or `ex`
Exports current address book data to a file with the specified filename in the data folder. +

While K.N.S provides automatic data saving, you can still manually back up your data using the `export` command.

To export your data, you should type: +
`export` or `ex` `FILENAME.xml` +
where FILENAME is the name you want to give to the exported data.

This will export your current address book data into a file with the specified filename.

[NOTE]
Exported data is saved in the `data` folder, which should be in the same folder as the application file, by default.

[WARNING]
If a file with the filename you entered already exists in the `data` folder, it _**will be overwritten**_ without warning!

Examples: +

* `export backup.xml` +
Exports your data in the `data` folder as `backup.xml` +

* `ex copy` +
Fails and will prompt you to add a `.xml` to the end of the file name.

=== Importing data: `import` or `i`
Imports data from the file in the given filepath, and overwrite current address book data. +

To import data from another application or your own backup data, you can use the `import` command with the format: +
`import` or `i FILEPATH` +
where FILEPATH is the relative filepath of the data to be imported. (Usually in the `data` folder)

[NOTE]
The data file to be imported does not have to be a `.xml` file, as long as the its contents are correctly formatted.

[WARNING]
When you import data, you cannot get your old data back once you close the application. +
 (_you can still use `undo` if you haven't_) +
It is recommended to backup using the `export` command first before importing.

Examples: +

* `import data/backup.xml` +
Imports the data in the file `backup.xml` in the `data` folder which should be located in the same folder as the application. +

* `i copy` +
Imports the data in the file `copy` which should be located at the same folder as the application. +

// end::exim[]
