== Introduction

Hello there! If you came here by choice, then chances are that you are interested in how we have further adapted from
the original source code (https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S1/addressbook-level4/[AddressBook-Level4 project])
provided by the https://github.com/se-edu[SE-EDU initiative]. This developer guide provides information that will help
you understand what features we have implemented, and how we have done so.

== Table Of Contents

toc::[]

== Setting Up

=== Prerequisites

Before you get stared, do ensure that you have the following installed on your computer:

* *Java SE Development Kit (JDK) `1.8.0_60`* or later
You can download link:#java[Java] SE Development Kit link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[here].
+
[NOTE]
This application will not work with earlier versions of Java 8 (_anything before `1.8.0_60`)_.
+

* *IntelliJ* Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
You can download IntelliJ IDE link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows[here].
+
[NOTE]
By default, IntelliJ has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed; do not disable them! If you have disabled them, go to
`File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

Once you have installed the above, you can continue on with the next step.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B3/main[this] repository to your GitHub account, and clone the fork to your
computer.
+
[NOTE]
Don't have a GitHub account? You can register for one https://github.com/[here].
. Open IntelliJ (_if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project
dialog first_)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command
.. `gradlew processResources` (_on Windows_)
.. `./gradlew processResources` (_on Mac OS X/Linux_)
+
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests. You should see a `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message.

=== Verifying the setup

. In Intellij, right click on the `seedu.address.MainApp` file and click `Run MainApp().main`. You should see the project building, and the application should start afterwards. Try a entering few commands in the application to ensure that the application is running.
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding
standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To
rectify this,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (_Windows/Linux_), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (_Mac OS X_)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent
IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`,
`import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check
style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up Continuous Integration (CI)

Set up Travis to perform CI for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (_see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>_).

[TIP]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (_Travis
is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based_).

==== Before coding

Before you start coding, do read the link:#architecture[Architecture] section below so that you can get a clearer sense of
the overall design of the application. This will help you understand how the application works, and how your changes
can affect the entire system.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

Lastly, if you plan to develop this as a separate product (_i.e. instead of contributing to the
`CS2103AUG2017-W11-B3/main`)_, you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and
`UserGuide.adoc` with your fork's URL, and make changes to the documentation where necessary.

== Design

=== Introduction: Architecture

The *_Architecture Diagram_* below explains the high-level design of the application:

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 4.1.1: Architecture Diagram_

==== `Main` Component

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible
for,

* *At application launch*: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* *At shut down*: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

==== `Commons` Component

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those
classes play important roles at the architecture level:

* `EventsCenter`: This class (_written using
https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]_) is used by components to
communicate with other components using events (_i.e. a form of Event Driven design_)
* `LogsCenter`: Used by most classes to write log messages to the application's log file.

==== The Other 4 Components

The rest of the App consists of four components:

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*]: The user interface (_UI_) of the application.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*]: The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*]: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*]: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

=== Events-Driven nature of the design

==== Components Interaction

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command
`delete 1`:

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.1.1: Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
`Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data is changed, instead of asking the `Storage`
to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved
to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.1.2: Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be
coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between
components.

=== UI Component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.1: Structure of the UI Component_

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All of these parts, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are
in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in
link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4.1: Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4.2: Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand`
and `Command` in Figure 4.4.1_

*API*:
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

*  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
*  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
*  The command execution can affect the `Model` (_e.g. adding a person_) and/or raise events.
*  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
API call:

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4.3: Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model Component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.5.1: Structure of the Model Component_

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage Component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.6.1: Structure of the Storage Component_

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams]
folder. To update a diagram, just modify the objects inside `.pptx` file to your liking, and then `Save as picture`.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo Mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing
and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (_e.g._ `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit
from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead.
The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.1.1: Inheritance diagram for Undo/Redo command_

`UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone,
such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such
as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those
extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this
technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child
classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state
of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the
`undoStack`. The current state is saved together with the command as shown:

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.1.2_

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may
execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person like so:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.1.3_

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the
address book to the state before the `add` command executed as shown:

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.1.4_

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when
popping the `undoStack`.

==== Sequence Diagram

The following link:#sequence-diagram[sequence diagram ]shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.1.1.1_

The redo does the exact opposite: pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state
after the command is executed.

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when
popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This
time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command
(this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.1.1.2_

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command`
rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.1.1.3_

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 5.1.1.4_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand`. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`. +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal
with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`. +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to
undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (_e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted_). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (_the view can easily be re-modified as no data is
lost_). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (_undoing filtering for example_), only to
realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and
not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion
https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo. +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new
incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both
`HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands.
Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different
things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::personpanel[]
=== Person Panel

The `PersonPanel` replaces the previous `BrowserPanel`, and is a crucial part of `MainWindow`. It is an event-driven
component that displays contact information depending on the user's actions

==== Java Implementation

By taking advantage of the `java.util.logging package`, PersonPanel is able to display all of the details of a contact
(_name, address, email, contact number, birthday, avatar, tags_) selected in `PersonCard`. This implementation can be
seen from the following 2 code snippets:

[source,java]
----
@Subscribe
private void handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent(PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent event) {
    loadBlankPersonPage();
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    selectedPersonCard = event.getNewSelection();
    selectedPerson = selectedPersonCard.person;
    isBlankPage = false;
    loadPersonPage();
}
----

**Code Snippet 1 (`handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent()`):** Whenever a contact is selected, an event will be
triggered. The method will respond to the event by obtaining a PersonCard variable and ReadOnlyPerson variable
(_which contains all the details of the contact_), and pass it into loadPersonPage().

[source,java]
----
private void loadPersonPage() {
    name.setText(selectedPerson.getName().fullName);
    phone.setText("Phone: " + selectedPerson.getPhone().toString());
    address.setText("Address: " + selectedPerson.getAddress().toString());
    email.setText("Email: " + selectedPerson.getEmail().toString());
    birthday.setText("Birthday: " + selectedPerson.getBirthday().toString());
    avatar.setImage(SwingFXUtils.toFXImage(selectedPerson.getAvatar().getImage(), null));
    selectedPerson.getTags().forEach(tag -> {
        Label tagLabel = new Label(tag.tagName);
        tagLabel.setStyle("-fx-background-color: " + tag.tagColour);
        tags.getChildren().add(tagLabel);
    });
}
----

**Code Snippet 2 (`loadPersonPage()`):** The ReadOnlyPerson variable passed into loadPersonPage can then be used to
extract the contact's details for display; the UI will be updated accordingly to reflect these changes.

[NOTE]
Upon opening the application, no contact details will be displayed since no contact has been selected yet.

To better illustrate the code snippets, let us look at the following sequence diagram when a user selects a contact
found in `PersonListPanel`:

image::SequenceDiagramSelectToPersonPanel.png[width="760"]
_Figure 5.2.1.1: Sequence Diagram for Selection_

When a contact in `PersonListPanel` is selected via `command` or mouse click, this will result in the `EventsCenter`
returning a `ReadOnlyPerson` of the selected contact for display in the `PersonPanel`.

==== Layout Implementation

The layout for PersonPanel is specified in `PersonPanel.fxml`. Visually, it can be broken down into 2 parts as shown:

image::PersonPanelLayout.png[width="760"]
_Figure 5.2.2.1: Visual Breakdown of PersonPanel_

**Part 1 (primaryDetails):** This is subdivided into parts A and B. Part A contains the link:#avatar[avatar] picture of the contact.
Clicking on the avatar picture will cause a new `AvatarWindow` to be generated, which allows users to change the current
avatar picture of the selected contact. More information about the implementation of `Avatar` can be found in the next section.

Part B contains the Name and Tags of the contact, which we found to be important in recognising a displayed contact
quickly. Hence, they are in a larger font in order to stand out.

**Part 2 (secondaryDetails):** This displays the Address, Email, Contact Number and Birthday of the contact. As these
details are less important than the Name and Tags, they are placed below and are in a smaller font. At the moment, this
section appears simple but empty. We plan to implement more features for v2.0, such as a "Notes about Contact" and
"Birthday Countdown".

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Display of Contact's Details. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Replace BrowserPanel with PersonPanel, which displays all of the contacts details.
Remove all details but Name and Tags from PersonCard.  +
**Pros:** We can build upon PersonPanel and add more features to it, that the BrowserPanel could not achieve.  +
**Cons:** PersonPanel will not be able to display personal web pages (_e.g. Contact's Social Media page_). +
**Alternative 2:** Keep BrowserPanel and use HTML files to display contact details instead. +
**Pros:** No need to modify existing code; instead just figure out a way to edit and display HTML files that show the
contact's details. +
**Cons:** May take too long to implement since we are not familiar with how we can do so.

---

**Aspect:** Display of Tags In PersonPanel (_and PersonCard_). +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Randomly colourise tags to make them distinct. +
**Pros:** Quick to implement and makes it easier for user to differentiate between tags. +
**Cons:** Tags are always changing colour for each new instance of the application; may seem confusing. +
**Alternative 2:** Keep the previous blue colour for all tags. +
**Pros:** Consistent and simple; no work is needed to be done. +
**Cons:** Takes users a longer time to differentiate between tags.

---

**Aspect:** Addition of Icons for secondaryDetails. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Place icons on the left of each contact detail. +
**Pros:** Quick to implement and makes it easier for user to differentiate between each contact detail. Icons can be
easily taken from Google's Material Design (_or any other design website_). +
**Cons:** If we were to include more contact details (_e.g. social media links_) in the future, then we would have to
keep adding more icons; relevant icons may not be found on Google's Material Design.  +
**Alternative 2:** Use different colours for each contact detail. +
**Pros:** Even more quick to implement since it only involves CSS changes. +
**Cons:** Bad idea design-wise because it violates the link:#tradic-colour-scheme[Triadic Colour Scheme]. It could make
the application look less professional and unattractive.
// end::personpanel[]

// tag::avatar[]
=== Avatar

The `Avatar` class is a new contact detail that displays a display picture obtained
via a valid Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or a local directory path in your computer.
If no display picture is assigned to the contact, then creates a default placeholder image.

In order for the user to upload an `Avatar` for the contact, he/she can use the Add/Edit `command` or Graphical
User Interface (GUI) upload (`AvatarWindow`) to do so.

==== Java Implementation: `Avatar`

The display and storage of `Avatar` can be seen in the following code snippets:

[source,java]
----
public Avatar() {
    AvatarUtil placeholder = new AvatarUtil();
    image = placeholder.getPlaceholderAvatar();
    value = DEFAULT_VALUE;
}
----
**Code Snippet 1 (`Avatar()`):** The default constructor for `Avatar` is used when no display
picture is assigned to a newly added contact. The default placeholder `Avatar` is generated
with the dependant class `AvatarUtil`.

[source,java]
----
public Avatar(String url) throws IllegalValueException {
    try {
        if (url.isEmpty() || DEFAULT_VALUE.equals(url)) {
            AvatarUtil placeholder = new AvatarUtil();
            image = placeholder.getPlaceholderAvatar();
            value = DEFAULT_VALUE;
        } else {
            File defaultAvatar = new File(url);

            if (isValidUrl(url)) {
                this.url = new URL(url);
            } else {
                this.url = defaultAvatar.toURI().toURL();
            }
            this.image = ImageIO.read(this.url);
			// Code Continued in Snippet 2B
----
**Code Snippet 2A (`Avatar(String url)`):** If a URL or local directory path string is provided,
then the parameterized constructor will check if the provided string is valid or not. If the string
is valid (i.e. non-empty and existing), then it will parse the URL and read the image given.

[source,java]
----
            if (!isSavedInData(url)) {
                String outputName = "/data/" + this.image.hashCode() + ".png";
                File outputImage = new File(System.getProperty("user.dir") + outputName);

                File parentDirectory = outputImage.getParentFile();
                if (!parentDirectory.exists()) {
                    parentDirectory.mkdirs();
                }

                ImageIO.write(this.image, "png", outputImage);
                this.url = outputImage.toURI().toURL();
            }
            this.value = this.url.toString();
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new IllegalValueException(MESSAGE_AVATAR_CONSTRAINTS);
    }
}
----
**Code Snippet 2B (`Avatar(String url)`):** If the image given has not yet been stored in the data
directory, it will generate a new file and save it.

To better illustrate the code snippets, here is a sequence diagram when a user changes a person's avatar with a new
image (_that is not currently stored in the data folder_):

image::SequenceDiagramEditContactAvatar.png[width="760"]
_Figure 5.3.1.1: Sequence Diagram for Changing Avatar_

[NOTE]
Changing the `Avatar` of a contact will result in an immediate display change to the user.

==== Dependant Class: `AvatarUtil`

AvatarUtil generates a default placeholder image if the contact is not given a display picture. It relies
on the `java.awt` library to generate a picture drawn by the methods found in `Graphics2D` and `Color`.

[NOTE]
You can find the full implementation of `AvatarUtil` in the folder `java/seedu/address/commons/util`.

==== Dependant Class: `AvatarWindow`

AvatarWindow is a UI component and is triggered when the current avatar of a contact is clicked on as such:

image::UiPersonPanel.png[width="760"]
_Figure 5.3.3.1: Avatar Window Pop-up_

A window will appear for the user to load and save a picture from the computer. If a valid picture is loaded and saved,
it will create an `Edit` command and raise a new event; this event is the same as typing an actual valid edit command,
and can also be undone or redone as per normal.

[NOTE]
You can find the full implementation of `AvatarWindow` in the folder `java/seedu/address/ui`.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Additional ways of changing `Avatar`. +
**Alternative 1:** Only allow user to use the Add and Edit commands to change the Avatar of the contact. +
**Pros:** No time is spent to make new ways of changing Avatar. +
**Cons:** May be stifling for users who want to have a GUI option. +
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Create a GUI alternative for users to change the Avatar of the contact. +
**Pros:** Makes the application more user friendly; easier for users to point and click instead of copying the
picture's directory path, which may take a longer time. +
**Cons:** Some classes (e.g. _PersonCard_, _PersonPanel_, etc.) have to be modified in order to implement this option.

---

**Aspect:** Saving of pictures. +
**Alternative 1:** Save the pictures within the `.jar` file. +
**Pros:** Users will not be able to modify the pictures downloaded; lesser chances of error exceptions occuring due
to missing files. +
**Cons:** May be inconvenient for a user who would want to manipulate these pictures directly for any purpose. +
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Save the pictures outside of the `.jar` file, inside the `data/` folder. +
**Pros:** Users will be able to directly access downloaded pictures and manipulate them as they please. +
**Cons:** If users are not careful (e.g. permanently.delete a picture by mistake), the contact's avatar may get
replaced by the default placeholder.

=== Import & Export Mechanism
The import and export mechanism is implemented using the `XmlAddressBookStorage` class. It allows for the manual saving and loading of the
address book data, aside from the default initial loading and automatic saving, by using the `export` and `import` command.


Import only changes the address book's data, and does not change the user preference. Notably, it does not change
the default file which the application automatically saves to, which is `addressbook.xml`. Instead, it overwrites the current data with
the data in the given filepath, provided it is a valid address book data.

The following shows the dependencies of both `ImportCommand` and `ExportCommand`:

image::ImportExportAssocDiagram.png[width="600"]
_Figure 5.4.1: Import/Export Association Diagram_

[NOTE]
If the `XmlAddressBookStorage` fails to read or write to file, an `Exception` will be thrown.
The same will happen if the file contains persons with illegal values. (e.g. empty name)

Suppose the user has just initialized the application, and the `data` folder is empty.

The user makes some changes to the data (e.g. using `clear` and `add` to clear away the sample and add their own contacts) which
saves the data in the `data` folder as `addressbook.xml` automatically.

Then, without altering the data any further, the user decides to save a manual backup using a `export backup.xml` command.
This will create a `backup.xml` file in the `data` folder, which at this point is equivalent to the `addressbook.xml`.

As the user continues to alter the data, the `addressbook.xml` file will keep changing, and will be different than the `backup.xml`
file. +
The user then decides that they want to return the addressbook to their backup version using a `import data/backup.xml` command. +
This will overwrite the current data with the data in `backup.xml`, making it once again equivalent to `addressbook.xml`

==== Sequence Diagram
The sequence diagram for the command `export a.xml` is the following:

image::ImportExportSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.4.1.1: Sequence Diagram for Export Command_

An `import` command would be similar, except that it creates a `XmlAddressBookStorage` object first, calls the `readAddressBook` method, and then
calls the `resetData` method from the `Model` object.

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect*: How import works +
*Alternative 1(current choice):* Overwrite the current address book with the data from the given file. +
*Pros:* Easier implementation, data in the given file is preserved. +
*Cons:* Loses the current address book data, which cannot be recovered if the address book is closed. (Can still be recovered with undo if it has not been closed since the import yet) +
*Alternative 2:* Switch the file that the address book uses to the given file, and save all changes to that file +
*Pros:* Allows for easier use of multiple saved files. The data in the current (before import) file is preserved. +
*Cons:* Harder implementation, does not provide an easy way to import backups, since all changes are saved to the given file. +

---
*Aspect*: Scope of data to export and import +
*Alternative 1(current choice):* Exports and imports only the address book data, excluding pictures and user preferences. +
*Pros:* Can use the current `XmlAddressBookStorage` class to read and write. Only read and write a single file. +
*Cons:* Excluding pictures means user have to manually backup pictures, otherwise address book is incomplete (no avatar). +
*Alternative 2:* Include pictures and/or user preferences +
*Pros:* More complete data storage. +
*Cons:* Higher probability of accidentally overwriting files if the user is not careful. +

// end::importexport[]

//tag::sort[]
=== Sorting viewable list

The `sort` command and auto-sorting of the `find` command is facilitated by a `SortedFilteredList` inside the `ModelManager` class. This list is created on top of
the `FilteredList` that is used to filter the contact list. A Comparator called `defaultSortOrder` was also created to as a
comparator to reset the sorted list to its default order. `ModelManager` was also modified to support updating the sorted list only,
and to always reset to default order whenever the filtered list is updated.

Commands that changes the viewable list without any sorting are implemented as:
[source, java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execure() {
        // ... some logic ...
        model.updateFilteredList(some predicate);
        // ... more logic ...
    }
----

Whereas commands with sorting (e.g. `find`) is implemented as:
[source, java]
----
public class FindCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... some logic ...
        model.updateFilteredList(some predicate);
        model.updateSortedFilteredList(some comparator);
        // ... more logic ...
    }
----

==== Auto-Sort of Find Command

The `find` command, when matching by name, sorts its resulting list by the earliest position of a match with a given keyword. +
This is implemented by creating a `earliestIndexOf` method in the `StringUtil` class, which takes in a sentence and a list of keywords, and returns the earliest starting index where a part of the sentence matches a keyword, or -1 if there are no match.

As an example, suppose the address book contains three people:

image::SortListUnsorted.png[width="200"]
_Figure 5.5.1.1: 3 People Listed in the PersonList_

When a `find n/ i` command is executed, it will match all three of them (since all their names contains i),
and show them in this order:

image::SortListSorted.png[width="200"]
_Figure 5.5.1.1: 3 People Listed in the New Order_

as M__**i**__chael has i in the 2nd position, Al__**i**__cia has an i in the 3rd position, and Dan__**i**__el has an i in
the 4th position.

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Implementation of sorting +
*Alternative 1 (current choice):* Sort the viewable list only by creating a `SortedFilteredList` +
*Pros:* Preserves the original order without additional changes, sort without worrying about changing the data. +
*Cons:* Harder to implement a permanent sort functionality. +
*Alternative 2:* Sort the data directly +
*Pros:* Easier to make a permanent sort.
*Cons:* Cannot go back to original order without additional changes. Harder to sort temporarily.

---

*Aspect:* Type of sorting in `find` +
*Alternative 1 (current choice):* Sort the resulting list of `find` by the earliest matching index. +
*Pros:* Make searching with short keywords more effective since the desired result is likely at the top. +
*Cons:* Can be unintuitive, especially since it's only done when finding by name. +
*Alternative 2:* Show the resulting list in the default sort order. +
*Pros:* More intuitive. No need for extra code. +
*Cons:* Harder to find desired person when the result list is long. +

---

*Aspect:* Mechanism to create comparators +
*Alternative 1 (current choice):* `sort` and `find` uses separate method to create Comparator +
*Pros:* More flexible since each command can do a different kind of sorting. +
*Cons:* A lot of similar logic is copied to implement the methods individually. +
*Alternative 2:* Create a class or method that returns Comparators. +
*Pros:* Only implement once. Each sorting method now just need to call this method. +
*Cons:* Take longer to code. Need to allow access to private variables in predicate classes. +

// end::sort[]

// tag::birthday[]

=== Birthday
The Birthday class enables users to store their contact's birthday details in K.N.S. Address Book. Birthday details
should be inputted in dd/mm/yyyy form, and will be stored in the address book in the same form. If the user chooses not
to enter their contact's birthday details, the address book will automatically store the default value for empty
birthday, which is `-`, and the value that will appear in the Person Panel for birthday field would be the default
value.

==== Java Implementation
The Birthday class is implemented in similar way like other fields, such as address, phone, and email.

[source, java]
----
    public Birthday(String birthday) throws IllegalValueException {
        requireNonNull(birthday);
        String trimmedBirthday = birthday.trim();
        if (!isValidBirthday(trimmedBirthday)) {
            throw new IllegalValueException(MESSAGE_BIRTHDAY_CONSTRAINTS);
        }
        this.value = trimmedBirthday;
    }

----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Birthday Input Format +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using dd/mm/yyyy as the input format  +
**Pros:** It is easier for users to remember the format, as it is the format that is commonly used. +
**Cons:** For some people who use mm/dd/yyyy format instead of dd/mm/yyyy format, they might need some time to adjust to
K.N.S Address Book's date format. K.N.S. Address Book assumes that the date entered is in dd/mm/yyyy format and will
not send an error message when the number is valid. These users might enter 03/05/2017 which they intend to be 5 March,
but the address book will interpret it as 3 May. +
**Alternative 2:** Using ddmmyyyy as the input format +
**Pros:** Faster to type as it consists of only numbers and no other characters. +
**Cons:** The format is not easy to read and is similar to phone number format.

// end::birthday[]

//tag::partialfind[]
=== Partial Find
The partial matching of the Find command is implemented by creating a method in the `StringUtil` class with the help of
the `regionMatches` method from the java `String` class.
It replaces the method for matching in all predicate classes that is used by the command.

[NOTE]

The Find command now only use partial matching and has lost the full matching functionality


Previously, the method used for matching was implemented as such:
[source, java]
----
public static boolean containsWordIgnoreCase(String sentence, String word) {
        // ...check and prepare arguments..
        for (String wordInSentence: wordsInPreppedSentence) {
            if (wordInSentence.equalsIgnoreCase(preppedWord)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
----

By using the `equalsIgnoreCase` method, the query word has to exactly match, ignoring case, the sentence word for the
method to return `true`. +



A slightly modified version of the previous method is created to allow for partial matching as such:
[source, java]
----
 public static boolean containsWordPartialIgnoreCase(String sentence, String word) {
        //..check and prepare arguments..
        return preppedSentence.contains(preppedWord);
    }
----

By using the `contains` method, the query word can now be a substring of the sentence word.
It also shortens the method, as there is no more need to check through word-by-word.

Afterwards, the use of the previous method in the Predicate classes in model
(_e.g._ `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`) is replaced with the new method so that the Find command actually uses partial matching.


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Exclusive use of partial matching. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Find command exclusively uses partial matching. +
**Pros:** Simple implementation, doesn't affect complexity from user's perspective and easier for users to utilize Find
command. +
**Cons:** Users lose the ability to do full matching when it would be useful
(_e.g. a lot of people with similiar names_). +
**Alternative 2:** Give the option to toggle/use either partial matching or full matching +
**Pros:** More flexible and powerful. +
**Cons:** Requires more complicated syntax which can be confusing to new users, most use cases are already covered by
partial matching.

---

**Aspect:** Type of partial matching +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Matches can be from anywhere in the word +
**Pros:** More intuitive way of searching, simpler to understand. +
**Cons:** Search results become less relevant for short keywords. (_Mitigated by sorting the results based on match position_) +
**Alternative 2:** Matches are required to be from the start of each word. +
**Pros:** Restricts the scope of search which increases relevancy but still giving enough flexibility for users. +
**Cons:** Can be unintuitive, less powerful. +

// end::partialfind[]

// tag::findbyallfield[]
=== Find by All Field
The find by all field feature is implemented by adding one argument, prefix of field that want to be searched, to the
`find` command parameter. If the user does not specify the prefix, the address book will automatically search the query
in the name field. The FindCommandParser will parse the input given by the user. The mechanism to find by each field is
implemented in <field name>ContainsKeywordPredicate class (i.e. NameContainsKeywordPredicate,
AddressContainsKeywordPredicate) inside Model component.

==== Java Implementation

The FindCommandParser is now able to parse the additional prefix argument, as shown in the code snippet below:

[source,java]
----
public FindCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        // make sure that the argument is valid
        // store the prefix inside String 'toSearch'
        // store the search query inside array of string 'keyword'

        if (toSearch.equals(PREFIX_TAG.getPrefix())) {
            return new FindCommand(new TagListContainsKeywordsPredicate(Arrays.asList(keywords)));
        } else if (toSearch.equals(PREFIX_PHONE.getPrefix())) {
            return new FindCommand(new PhoneContainsKeywordsPredicate(Arrays.asList(keywords)));
        } else if (toSearch.equals(PREFIX_EMAIL.getPrefix())) {
            return new FindCommand(new EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate(Arrays.asList(keywords)));
        } else if (toSearch.equals(PREFIX_ADDRESS.getPrefix())) {
            return new FindCommand(new AddressContainsKeywordsPredicate(Arrays.asList(keywords)));
        } else if (toSearch.equals(PREFIX_BIRTHDAY.getPrefix())) {
            return new FindCommand(new BirthdayContainsKeywordsPredicate(Arrays.asList(keywords)));
        } else {
            return new FindCommand(new NameContainsKeywordsPredicate(Arrays.asList(keywords)));
        }
    }
----

After FindCommandParser parse the arguments, it will call the <field name>ContainsKeywordsPredicate class for each
respective field.

All contacts with partial matches will appear on the search result, implemented in the method below for phone field.
The method is similar for other field.

[source,java]
----
public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        return keywords.stream().anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil
                .containsWordPartialIgnoreCase(person.getPhone().value, keyword));
    }
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of find by all field +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Enables user to find by all field (name, phone, email, address, birthday, and
tag). +
**Pros:** Easier for user to find their contacts when the user does not remember their contact's name, instead they
remember the contacts' details (such as address or birthday). This feature is useful for a broader range of purpose,
for example when the user wants to send a birthday wishes to their contacts, the user can easily find by using
birthday field. +
**Cons:** Need to type the prefix of the field that want to be searched. +
**Alternative 2:** Find by name only. +
**Pros:** Some people only remember their contact's name, and find by all field feature might not be useful for them as
they don't remember their contact's details. +
**Cons:** User could not find their contact details when they do not remember their contact's name.

---

**Aspect:** Find result upon executing `find` command. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** All contacts with partial match with the find query will appear. +
**Pros:** With less restrictive requirement, users can find a broad range of contacts when they are searching using a
global keyword. For example, a user can find all their contacts who lived in "Clementi" when using this alternative. +
**Cons:** More contacts will appear on the find result, some of them might not be the target contact that the user
wants to find. +
**Alternative 2:** Only contacts with exact match will appear. +
**Pros:** Less contacts will appear on the find result, easier to find the exact person while searching for a single
person. +
**Cons:** It will be hard for a forgetful user to find their contacts as they may remember their contact details'
partially. This alternative is also more cumbersome when applied to find by address, as user need to type the full
address of their contact.

// end::findbyallfield[]

// tag::adddeletetagcommand[]
=== Add Tag and Delete Tag

Add tag and delete tag mechanism is facilitated by the `addtag` command and `deletetag` command, or their equivalent
aliases `at` and `dt`, which is useful for adding and deleting tags in a person's tag list. On previous versions
before Add and Delete tag feature was introduced, users are able to change a person's tag list by using `edit` command.
Using `edit` command to add and delete tags is quite cumbersome as users need to retype all the current tags that they
didn't want to edit. `addtag` command and `deletetag` command enables user to add and delete tags using only a single
command, without retyping all the current tags.

==== Java Implementation

As `addtag` and `deletetag` are commands, their implementations are a part of Logic component in the address book.
The implementation of add tag and delete tag can be found in AddTagCommand and DeleteTagCommand. AddTagCommand and
DeleteTagCommand inherits UndoableCommands, as they modify the state of the address book (_adding and deleting a
person's tag in the address book_). Therefore, users can undo/redo their previously entered `addtag` and `deletetag`
command.

`addtag` command is implemented in this way:

[source,java]
----
public class AddTagCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

`addtag` command can be used by calling the method with an index and a string of tag name that will be added, shown by
this code snippet:

[source,java]
----
public AddTagCommand(Index index, Set<Tag> addedTag) {
    requireNonNull(index);
    requireNonNull(addedTag);

    this.index = index;
    this.addedTag = addedTag;
}
----

Similar to `addtag` command, `deletetag` command is implemented in this way:

[source,java]
----
public class DeleteTagCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

`deletetag` command can be used by calling the method with an index and a string of tag name that will be added, just
like `addtag` command, shown by the following code snippet:

[source,java]
----
public DeleteTagCommand(Index index, Set<Tag> deletedTag) {
    requireNonNull(index);
    requireNonNull(deletedTag);

    this.index = index;
    this.addedTag = deletedTag;
}
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of AddTagCommand and DeleteTagCommand +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implementing a new command `addtag` and `deletetag` instead of using the existing
Edit command.  +
**Pros:** Users can add and delete a single tag only by typing the new tag that they want to assign or remove from
a contact. `addtag` and `deletetag` supports adding and deleting several tags at a single execution. +
**Cons:** More commands to remember. +
**Alternative 2:** Use existing Edit command to add or delete tags from a person in the address book. +
**Pros:** Less commands to remember. +
**Cons:** Users need to retype all existing tags they want to keep when they are using `edit` command. Users might
mistype existing tags or not typing a complete set of existing tags while using `edit` command.

// end::adddeletetagcommand[]

// tag::themeswitcher[]
=== Theme Switcher
The Theme Switcher allows users to change the appearance of the application via the command `theme` or the drop-down
selection in the `MenuBar`. There are 5 themes for users to choose from: Light, Dark, Red, Blue, and Green. Here is what
the application looks like in each theme:

image::UiAllThemes.gif[width="668"]
_Figure 5.10.1: All 5 Themes of the Application_

==== Java Implementation

The Theme Switcher mainly spans over the `Logic` and `UI` components.

[source,java]
----
@Override
public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
    if (!isValidTheme(this.theme)) {
        throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_THEME);
    }
    if ((MainWindow.getCurrentTheme()).contains(this.theme)) {
        throw new CommandException("Theme is already set to " + this.theme + "!");
    }
    EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ChangeThemeRequestEvent(this.theme));
    return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_THEME_SUCCESS, this.theme));
}
----
**Code Snippet 1A (`execute()`):** When the `theme` command is executed, it checks for two conditions:

. **Theme Validity** -> It checks the input arguments for the 5 preset themes. If an invalid theme is given, then a
`CommandException` is thrown to inform the user that their input theme does not exist.
. **Current Theme Displayed** -> In order to prevent the user from setting the current theme to the same exact theme, it
checks whether the valid argument is currently the displayed theme. If it is, then a `CommandException` is thrown to
inform the user of their error.

If the two conditions are fulfilled, then the `theme` command will generate a new `ChangeThemeRequestEvent` for
`MainWindow` to accept, and return a successful `CommandResult`.

[source,java]
----
@Subscribe
public void handleChangeThemeRequestEvent(ChangeThemeRequestEvent event) throws CommandException, ParseException {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    mainWindow.getStylesheets().remove(currentTheme);
    prefs.setAddressBookTheme(event.theme + "Theme.css");
    currentTheme = "view/" + prefs.getAddressBookTheme();
    mainWindow.getStylesheets().add(currentTheme);
}
----
**Code Snippet 1B (`handleChangeThemeRequestEvent(ChangeThemeRequestEvent event)`):** The `event` generated by the
`theme` command is received in `MainWindow`. It takes removes the CSS for the current theme, and replaces it with the
input theme's CSS. The change in appearance is reflected immediately.

To better illustrate code snippets 1A and 1B, the following sequence diagram demonstrates a user entering a valid `theme` command input:

image::SequenceDiagramValidThemeCommand.png[width="668"]
_Figure 5.10.1.1: Sequence Diagram for Valid Theme Command_

[NOTE]
`MainWindow` does not need to check for the theme validity or whether the same theme is being set, because the `theme`
command has already accounted for these conditions.

[source,java]
----
@FXML
private void setToVALIDTheme() {
    if (checkSameTheme("VALID")) {
        return;
    }
    mainWindow.getStylesheets().remove(currentTheme);
    prefs.setAddressBookTheme("VALIDTheme.css");
    currentTheme = "view/" + prefs.getAddressBookTheme();
    mainWindow.getStylesheets().add(currentTheme);
    EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ChangeThemeRequestEvent("VALID"));
    raise(new NewResultAvailableEvent("Theme updated to: VALID", false));
}
----
**Code Snippet 2 (`setToVALIDTheme()`):** Where "_VALID_" is Light, Dark, Red, Blue or Green. If the user uses the
`MenuBar` to change the current theme, then it will call the appropriate method to change the current theme to it. Also,
the method ensures that if the user selects the theme that is already being displayed, it will raise a
`NewResultAvailableEvent` to inform the user of their error.

[NOTE]
`MainWindow` needs to check whether the same theme is being set since no `theme` command is being executed.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Providing a GUI option for switching themes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Provide a GUI option via the `MenuBar`. +
**Pros:** Simple to implement and users can change themes seamlessly. +
**Cons:** Users will not know what the colour scheme of the theme looks like unless they change to it. +
**Alternative 2:** Provide a GUI option via coloured buttons. +
**Pros:** Users will be able to see the colour scheme of the theme before changing to it. +
**Cons:** Users may get confused as to what these buttons are for.

// end::themeswitcher[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and
logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
(_See link:#configuration[Configuration]_).
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the
specified logging level.
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE`: Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING`: Can continue, but with caution.
* `INFO`: Information showing the noteworthy actions by the application.
* `FINE`: Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of
just its size.

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file
(_default:_ `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility
in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview
the end result of your edits. Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to
preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as
Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files
in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` ->
`Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results,
use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]
_Figure 6.3.1: Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome_

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to
platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (_Mac/Linux:_ `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode.
In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests`
(_Mac/Linux:_ `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the
`systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (_those code units are assumed to be
working_). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected
together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on
our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file
you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the
http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these dependencies can be automated
using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than
these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (_this bloats the repo size_) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (_this creates extra work for developers_)
