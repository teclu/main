=== Enhancement Added: Person Panel

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=personpanel]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Previously, the `Person Card` was the only thing that showed all the details of a contact. It was too small to fit all
of the text. Aesthetically, this is not good because information should not be crammed into a small area. Thus, I
created a `Person Panel` which shows all the contact's details in one page in order to improve aesthetic design and
readability.

=== Enhancement Added: Avatar

==== External behavior

---
`Avatar` is the contact's display picture that can be found in the `Person Panel`. When using the `add` or `edit` command,
you can change the `Avatar` by entering a valid URL or file path on the computer. If no URL or file path is provided,
a default placeholder `Avatar` is created.

Alternatively, clicking on the display picture in `Person Panel` will bring up a GUI upload window for users to specify
a picture to be used in their computer.

---

==== Justification

It is important to know what your contact looks like, especially so if you do not meet him/her frequently. Also, most
freelancers have many clients to keep up with; it is likely that they may forget how their client looks like over time.

The alternative way of editing the `Avatar` is useful for users who are unsure as to how to get the actual file path of
the image found in their computer. Also, the file path may be very long, and this will cause the command box to be
overfilled with text (_causing parts of the text to be hidden_). This can be frustrating for users who would want to
check whether they have entered the correct details in the `add` or `edit` command.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Birthday Countdown & Reminders

==== Justification

With the inclusion of a birthday field (_implemented by Nadhira_), it would be useful to the user if the AddressBook can inform
him/her of a contact's upcoming birthday. To a freelancer, this can be very important because he/she would want to make themselves
appear professional and thoughtful by wishing their clients happy birthday.
