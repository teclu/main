== Project: K.N.S. AddressBook
K.N.S. AddressBook is a Java desktop address book application created by *Team W11-B3* during the course of *CS2103T
Software Engineering* in AY2017/8 Semester 1. This portfolio page will show you the contributions I have made to our
project.

=== Enhancement Added: Avatar

==== External behavior

---
`Avatar` is the contact's display picture that can be found in the `Person Panel`. When using the `add` or `edit` command,
you can change the `Avatar` by entering a valid URL or file path on the computer. If no URL or file path is provided,
a default placeholder `Avatar` is created.

Alternatively, clicking on the display picture in `Person Panel` will bring up a GUI upload window for users to specify
a picture to be used in their computer.

---

==== Justification

It is important to know what your contact looks like, especially so if you do not meet him/her frequently. Also, most
freelancers have many clients to keep up with; it is likely that they may forget how their client looks like over time.

The alternative way of editing the `Avatar` is useful for users who are unsure as to how to get the actual file path of
the image found in their computer. Also, the file path may be very long, and this will cause the command box to be
overfilled with text (_causing parts of the text to be hidden_). This can be frustrating for users who would want to
check whether they have entered the correct details in the `add` or `edit` command.

=== Enhancement Added: Person Panel

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=personpanel]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

Previously, the `Person Card` was the only thing that showed all the details of a contact. It was too small to fit all
of the text. Aesthetically, this is not good because information should not be crammed into a small area. Thus, I
created a `Person Panel` which shows all the contact's details in one page in order to improve aesthetic design and
readability.

=== Enhancement Added: Theme Switcher

#End of Extract#

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=themecommand]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

Previously, there was only the dark theme in place for the application. We felt that some of the users may not like this
default colour scheme, and may not like that they cannot personalise the application's appearance to their liking. Thus,
in order to make the application more attractive visually, we have decided to add more themes for users to choose from.
It is important for users to have more choices in how their address book looks like, because it gives them a sense of
ownership and allows them to express themselves in someway.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Notes For Contacts

==== Justification

The current version of K.N.S. AddressBook only displays the predetermined details of a contact. It would be useful for
a freelancer to be able to note down other miscellaneous details about their clients within the application, so that
they do not have to save these details elsewhere. For example, a freelancer may want to note down information about when
and where they are meeting their client the next time.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Birthday Countdown & Reminders

==== Justification

With the inclusion of a birthday field (_implemented by Nadhira_), it would be useful to the user if the AddressBook can
inform him/her of a contact's upcoming birthday. To a freelancer, this can be very important because he/she would want
to make themselves appear professional and thoughtful by wishing their clients happy birthday.
