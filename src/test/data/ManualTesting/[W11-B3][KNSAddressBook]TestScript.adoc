== Setting Up
. Ensure that you have downloaded the following files from IVLE:
* **Jar Executable**: `[W11-B3][KNSAddressBook].jar`
* **Sample Data**: `[W11-B3][KNSAddressBook]SampleData.xml`
* **User Guide**: `[W11-B3][KNSAddressBook]UserGuide.pdf`
* **Developer Guide**: `[W11-B3][KNSAddressBook]DeveloperGuide.pdf`
* **3 Portfolios**: `[W11-B3][Kevin Leonardo Anantha]Portfolio.pdf`, `[W11-B3][Nadhira Salsabila]Portfolio.pdf` and `[W11-B3][Tay Wan Feng Stanley]Portfolio.pdf`
. Create a new folder called "_KNS_" and place the `.jar` file inside.
. Inside "_KNS_", create a new folder called "_data_" and place the `.xml` file inside.
. Inside "_KNS_", create a new folder called "_documentation_" and place all of the `.pdf` files inside.
. Rename the `.xml` file to `addressbook.xml`.
. Execute the `.jar` file to launch K.N.S. AddressBook.

== Basic Commands

[TIP]
You may want to view our https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#command-cheat-sheet[Command Cheat Sheet]. It shows all the commands available in the application!

=== Add

[TIP]
You can use the alias `a` in place of `add`.

* **Adding without any parameters:**
.. Type `add` in the command box and press kbd:[Enter].
.. You should see the error message `Invalid command format! ...`, with instructions on how to use the command.

* **Adding with only the name parameter:**
.. Type `add n/Damith Rajapakse` in the command box and press kbd:[Enter].
.. You should see `New person added: Name: Damith C Rajapakse ...`; the fields for phone, email, address and birthday should have a "_-_", the field for avatar should be "_No Avatar_", and the field for tags should be empty.

* **Adding with the name parameter and only some parameters:**
.. Type `add n/Aaron Tan p/91234567 b/01/01/1995` in the command box and press kbd:[Enter].
[TIP]
You may try this out with other valid parameters.

You will need internet connectivity for this!

[TIP]
Alternatively, you can use a valid `.JPG` or `.PNG` image filepath found in your computer for the avatar field. This does not require internet connectivity. Also, do take note that some online URLs that do not have the `.JPG` or `.PNG` present at the end of the link will not work; an invalid message will be given.
.. You should see `New person added: Name: Terence Chok ...`; the fields for phone, email, address and birthday should have a "_-_", the field for avatar should have the file path for the image (_which is stored in the data folder_), and the field for tags should be empty.

. You should see the contact removed, and his details should no longer appear in the `PersonPanel`.

[NOTE]
The input arguments are **case-insensitive**, so `theme DARK` and `theme GrEeN` will work.

[NOTE]
You can also use the theme switcher found in the menu bar to verify these changes.
. Type `theme Light` and press kbd:[Enter] twice (_you may use any other theme_). You should see the error message `Theme is already set to Light!`

=== List

[TIP]
You can use the alias `l` in place of `list`.

[NOTE]
Typing `list` in the command box twice in succession will still generate the message `Listed all persons`; this is **not a bug** and it has been implemented like this in the source code from AddressBook-Level4.

. Use any of the following commands to change the order of the `PersonList`: `find`, `import` and `sort`.
. Type `list` and press kbd:[Enter]. You should see that `PersonList` shows all the contacts arranged in chronological order (_i.e. least to most recently added contact_), and the message `Listed all persons`.
